      "From Alexander onwards the Greeks, the Turks, the Moguls, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. You say that the phones donâ€™t work, the railways are a joke, the airline is the worst in the world, and mails never reach their destination. of Space, Professor Satish Dhawan, who succeeded him and Dr. Brahm Prakash, father of nuclear material. In 3000 years of our history people from all over the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. You say, say and say. Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Yet we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured. We have not grabbed their land, their culture and their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. If we are not free, no one will respect us.
